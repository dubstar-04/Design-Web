# Deploy

Similar to [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com), you can deploy files to GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages or VPS.

## GitHub Pages

There're three places to populate your docs for your Github repository:

- `docs/` folder
- master branch
- gh-pages branch

It is recommended that you save your files to the `./docs` subfolder of the `master` branch of your repository. Then select `master branch /docs folder` as your Github Pages source in your repositories' settings page.

!> You can also save files in the root directory and select `master branch`.
You'll need to place a `.nojekyll` file in the deploy location (such as `/docs` or the gh-pages branch

## GitLab Pages

If you are deploying your master branch, include `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the following script:

?> The `.public` workaround is so `cp` doesn't also copy `public/` to itself in an infinite loop.

```YAML
pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
  - mkdir .public
  - cp -r * .public
  - mv .public public
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  only:
  - master
```

!> You can replace script with `- cp -r docs/. public`, if `./docs` is your Docsify subfolder.

## Firebase Hosting

!> You'll need to install the Firebase CLI using `npm i -g firebase-tools` after signing into the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) using a Google Account.

Using Terminal determine and navigate to the directory for your Firebase Project - this could be `~/Projects/Docs` etc. From there, run `firebase init`, choosing `Hosting` from the menu (use **space** to select, **arrow keys** to change options and **enter** to confirm). Follow the setup instructions.

You should have your `firebase.json` file looking similar to this (I changed the deployment directory from `public` to `site`):

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "site",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"]
  }
}
```

Once finished, build the starting template by running `docsify init ./site` (replacing site with the deployment directory you determined when running `firebase init` - public by default). Add/edit the documentation, then run `firebase deploy` from the base project directory.

## VPS

Try following nginx config.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name  your.domain.com;

  location / {
    alias /path/to/dir/of/docs;
    index index.html;
  }
}
```

## Netlify

1.  Login to your [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account.
2.  In the [dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/) page, click **New site from Git**.
3.  Choose a repository where you store your docs, leave the **Build Command** area blank, fill in the Publish directory area with the directory of your `index.html`, for example it should be docs if you populated it at `docs/index.html`.

### HTML5 router

When using the HTML5 router, you need to set up redirect rules that redirect all requests to your `index.html`, it's pretty simple when you're using Netlify, populate a `\redirects` file in the docs directory and you're all set:

```sh
/*    /index.html   200
```
