# language highlight

**docsify** uses [Prism](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) to highlight code blocks in your pages. By default it only supports CSS, JavaScript and HTML. You can make **Prism** load additional languages:

```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/docsify/lib/docsify.min.js"></script>
<script src="//unpkg.com/prismjs/components/prism-bash.min.js"></script>
<script src="//unpkg.com/prismjs/components/prism-php.min.js"></script>
```

?> Check the [component files](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/tree/gh-pages/components) list for more options.
